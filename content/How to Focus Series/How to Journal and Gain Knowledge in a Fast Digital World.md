#### Master Focused Journaling and Note-Taking Skills Effortlessly.

> “Know thyself” 
> -a philosophical maxim that originated in ancient Greece

## First, Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

### Why? 
It's offline, it stores all notes you could ever want however you want, and it lets you easily link files together creating a knowledge tree. Simple. You don't need to get distracted searching the web or ever opening your mind to the internet to use it day-to-day. If you want them stored across devices with common cloud storage like OneDrive, iCloud, or Google Drive, it just works out of the box. Your notes, or "vault", is a private file folder you own and have full control over.

## Start Using Built-in Daily Notes Plugin

### Create a Journal Template or Prompts
1. Add a new note for your journal template.

2. You can name it something like "Daily Journal Template"

3. Add some daily prompts that may help you brain dump, such as starting with a reminder to express gratitude.
   
   Obsidian notes are stored in a great file format called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
   You don't need to understand Markdown to journal.
   
   If you want a starting template, just copy and paste this into your template:

### Activate the Built-in Daily Notes Plugin
1. Open settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom right:

2. Select Core Plugins on the side bar:
   
   ![[open obsidian core plugins.png]]
   
3. Turn on the plugin:
   
   ![[turn on daily note plugin.png]]
   
4. Open the plugin settings:
   
   ![[open daily note plugin settings.png]]
   
5. Start typing the name of your daily note template:
   ![[select daily note template in daily note plugin.png]]
   
6. It will autocomplete as you type. Click the name of your template.

7. Make sure to turn on "Open daily note on startup" so you're ready to journal as soon as possible each day:

## Remove Program Distractions
With Obsidian open:
- click the gear icon to open settings
- click "Appearance"
- scroll to CSS snippets
- click the folder icon
- drop this [[Focus Mode.css]] snippet in that operating system folder
- go back to the folder icon, and click the refresh circle arrows icon
- turn on the "Focus Mode" 
![[Obsidian Focus Mode.mp4]]
That will hide the toolbars until you hover on them so you're not staring at icons and word counts

## Remove Computer Operating System Distractions (Windows Only)
### Next we need to hide the entire operating system, so you forget you're even on a computer.
MacOS has a decent setting to hide the task bar or enter full screen with the green icon in the top of any window.
On Windows, there is a setting to hide the task bar:

![[auto hide taskbar on windows.png]]

However, I find this to be clunky. It's slow to open, and I only want to hide the task bar when I'm doing intensive single program work, like creative writing.

### Pro Move for Focusing on Windows
1. Download this ~250kb exe file https://www.thewindowsclub.com/hide-taskbar-windows-7-hotkey. 
I have used it for a long time now, it's legit.
2. Put it anywhere, such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Hide Taskbar` if you'd like to forget about it.
3. Right click on the file, and click "Create Shortcut". You may have to click "Show more options" to see it.
4. Copy, cut, or keep the shortcut ready to move.
5. Press Windows+R keys
6. type `shell:startup` and press OK.
   ![[open shell-startup.png]]
7. Put shortcut in there.

Now whenever you're computer turns on, you can press Ctrl+Escape to hide the taskbar without going into settings.

## You can now make this your entire screen easily in seconds:

# And whatever you do...
### Don't Stop Writing. 
#### Is it a computer or a type writer at this point? You decide.

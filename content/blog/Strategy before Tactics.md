## Morning Reality

When you wake up in the morning, you will have a lot of todos. Whether you wrote them down, are stressing about them, or they're in the back of your mind, many necessities will hammer at and demand your attention.

## Todo Lists: Non-Essential Tools

Having a todo list can be important for most people, but the best time to create and use them is after your non-urgent strategic activities with long-term benefits are complete. If you make a rough todo list the night before, you won't be subconsciously worried about what you're missing when you wake up. You also won't even need to look at it, and that's the spot you want to be in. If you do not tackle your non-urgent strategic goals with long-term benefits first, like working out, learning a new skill, or building a personal project, they will not get done. Your tactical short-term todos will take over the day and you will get lost in the narrow view of battle. You must pick your battles ahead of time before the chaos of the day reigns.

## Strategy before Tactics: Avoid Regret

There will be urgent short-term tactical todos at work and in general life that are extremely important. But many people hit these deadlines 99% of the time. Consider the possibility that if you hit 90% of your inevitable short-term urgent deadlines AND achieved your life's mission, you would've achieved far more than the 99%-perfect tactical todo completer that died without grand life goals. Now consider the possibility that achieving your long-term strategic goals before entering short-term todo tactical battle energizes all aspects of your life; The commander who strategically prepared in all ways has set you up to win every battle.

## The Early Bird's Strategic Advantage

For most people, short-term tactical activities like work obligations must start in the morning. While the idea of waking up at 4-5 AM might seem daunting or even unnecessary, it's usually the most powerful way to carve out time for your strategic goals before the day's tactical demands begin. This is an informal yet convincing argument that I will be wrestling with for some time. I hope you find it easier than I do.

### Godspeed

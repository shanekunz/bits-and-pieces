## Morning Reality

When you wake up in the morning, you will have a lot of todos. Whether you wrote them down, are stressing about them, or their in the back of your mind, many necessary will hammer at and demand your attention.

## Todo Lists: Non-Essential Tools

Having a todo list can be important for most people, but the time to create and use them is after your essential long-term strategic activities are complete. If you make a rough todo list the night before, you won't be subconsicously worried about what you're missing when you wake up. You also won't even need to look at it, and that's the spot you want to be. If you do not tackle your long-term strategic goals first, like working out, learning a new skill, or building a personal project, they will not get done. Your tactical short-term todos will take over the day and you will get lost in the short-sighted battles. You must pick your battles ahead of time before the chaos of the day reigns.

## Strategy before Tactics: Avoid Regret

There will be urgent short-term tactical todos at work and in general life that are extremely important. But many people hit these deadlines 99% of the time. Consider the possibility that if you hit 90% of your inevitble short-term urgent deadlines AND achieved your life's mission, you would've achieved far more than the 99% perfect todolister that died without external goals. Now consider the possibility that achieving your long-term strategic goals before entering short-term todo tactical battle energizes all aspects of your life; The commander who strategically prepared in all ways has setup you up to better win every battle.

## The Final Frontier

Most people can accept everything up to this last point. For most, the short-term tactical work and chores must start in the morning. You may have looked upon people who wake up at 4AM-5AM negatively for your own sake, but this has been a mathematical proof on why it is necessary to live a non-boring life. And it is something I am still resting with.

### Godspeed

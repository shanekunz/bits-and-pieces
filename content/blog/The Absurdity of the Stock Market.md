## Why We Need to Rethink Corporate Finance

### The Stock Market: A Societal Pillar or a House of Cards?
If you're like me, you may have never fundamentally questioned the stock market. You may have felt at times that it represents corporate greed, or that it's rigged by insider trading and hedge funds. But we often think of the stock ownership as a fundamental concept in human society, and that the solution to any of its problem should be reform, not dissolution. We may think that the stock market is required for large companies to raise capital and for investors to share in the profits of a company. But when we finally stop to deeply examine public stock ownership, we only find unnecessary contradictions and absurdities.

### The Disconnect Between Ownership and Control
To own a share of a company, means to own the company. When entrepreneurs start companies, we unanimously agree they own the company. We also unanimously agree, at least in the early business, that the success of that business is determined by the blood, sweat, and tears of the owners. They own the business, and they *are* the business.

However, when a shareholder buys a share of a stock on the public stock market, they have little to no say in any operation in the entire company. Managers and executives who may have no ownership of the company have all legal control. There is almost nothing else in life that we can buy but not control. We can't buy homes that we can never enter; We can't buy sandwiches that we are never allowed to eat.

### Debt Beats Ownership: The Paradox of Corporate Control
The lack of ownership rights on public stock markets lead to another contradiction. In a rational system, owners (shareholders in a publicly traded company) have ultimate control of assets and the company's fate. However, in our current system, the opposite is true.

Somehow, in our companies, debt holders have true power, the power that stock owners never get. When a company is in financial distress, a debt holder can control all its assets, decisions, and processes. Shareholders have almost no say in the companies they own, and in financial distress they can be wiped out entirely.

This contradiction highlights that the modern corporation has evolved into a complex web of irrational abstract claims and legal fiction that usually have little resemblance to reality.

### The Illusion of Profit Sharing
Besides controlling a company, one of the supposed benefits of company ownership is that the owners get to share in company profits. But many companies never pay dividends to shareholders, and of the few that do, it's almost always a tiny fraction of total profits.

Company profits go to salaries, cash stashes, development, and financial engineering like stock buybacks, not to shareholders. The profits mostly benefit only a few executives at the company and at large institutional shareholding companies. If you're lucky enough to trade stocks for gains, you're largely dealing in hype, sentiment, speculation, and many assets that are widely agreed as intangible nothingness at the time of appraisal. The stocks traded today have more in common with NFTs than the company ownership concept that they were designed to represent.

### The Stock Market: Bad for Business
Not only does this system fail to deliver real profits to most shareholders, it also has profound negative consequences for the businesses themselves. When publicly traded companies find themselves caught in the boom and bust cycles characteristic of digital tokens valued by popularity, they are more likely to misallocate resources, plan, budget, build investor trust, and retain talent with compensation packages. Ultimately, the stock market is a distraction to real business ownership and owners ability to run real businesses.

The stock market's purported benefits for businesses, such as access to capital, are often overstated. While many subconsciously believe that the stock market is essential for businesses to raise capital, this is not true. There are numerous other ways for companies to secure funding, including debt financing, private equity, venture capital, and crowdfunding. These alternatives often come with the added benefit of allowing founders and owners to retain more control over their companies and focus on long-term growth rather than short-term stock price fluctuations.

### Alternative Ownership Models
Discovering the absurdity apparent in public stock ownership and its need for dissolution due to its shaky foundation requires us to propose alternatives. If any corporate structures can sensibly align the interest of all stakeholders and reconnect business ownership with full responsibility and control, we would clearly have a better system that mirrors the concept of ownership in all other life contexts.

1. **Enforcing a greater reliance on debt financing**: This provides capital without the deserving owners surrendering ownership. Crowd-sourced debt financing can be as far reaching as public stock ownership. While debt sometimes comes with unique legal challenges, to the investors, the downside to a default is nearly the same as a stock price hitting zero.
2. **Cooperatives**: Businesses owned and controlled by their members, who are usually the people who use its services or products. Profits are distributed based on participation, not ownership share. Examples include credit unions and agricultural co-ops.
3. **Steward-Ownership**: Companies owned by a trust or foundation and managed for the benefit of its mission and stakeholders, not to enrich absentee shareholders. Profits are reinvested or donated. Examples include Bosch and Zeiss.
4. **Mission-Driven Entities**: Businesses with a social or environmental mission. They can be benefit corporations (B-Corps) or social purpose corporations. They don't fundamentally solve the problem of absentee ownership and the disconnect between shareholders and the company's operations. However, they do represent an attempt to realign corporate priorities and make businesses more accountable to a broader set of stakeholders. Examples include Patagonia and Kickstarter.
5. **ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans)**: A plan that gives workers ownership in the company. Employees earn a financial stake over time, and the company gets tax benefits. By giving employees a real stake in the company's success, ESOPs align the interests of workers with the long-term health of the business. It creates a culture of ownership, engagement, and accountability. This is a stark contrast to the modern stock market, where shareholders have little connection to the companies they own. Examples include New Belgium Brewing and W.L. Gore (makers of Gore-Tex).

I believe these alternatives align ownership with stakeholders. They help fix the problematic nonsensical absentee shareholder model that we mistakenly assume is an irreplaceable fundamental law of social physics.

### Towards a More Rational Corporate Future
The current system of public stock ownership is a contradiction and absurdity. It creates a disconnect between ownership and control, inversion of traditional ownership rights, an illusion of profit sharing, and doesn't help businesses succeed long-term.

Upon closer inspection, stock markets seem to have more in common with a hypothetical horse race, than an ethical business process. But abolishing stock markets will likely never happen, and may not be a worthwhile fight in most possible circumstances. No matter what, it's of everyone's benefit to strive for a more rational and balanced ecosystem in corporate finance. By exploring alternative models that better align with stakeholder incentives and reconnect ownership with stewardship, we can work towards building a more equitable, sustainable, and productive economy for the long term. When we question the assumptions and abstractions of the current system - we begin to envision and build a better one.

If you're inspired by the potential of alternative ownership models like ESOPs, I encourage you to learn more and get involved by checking out the resources at the National Center for Employee Ownership ([https://www.nceo.org/](https://www.nceo.org/)), and consider advocating for policies and practices that support the growth of a more equitable and sustainable economy.

## Why We Need to Rethink Corporate Finance

### Is The Stockmarket a Fundamental Concept?
If you're like me, you may have never fundamentally questioned the stock market. You may have felt it sometimes represents corporate greed, or that it's rigged by insider trading or hedge funds. But we often think stock ownership is a fundamental societal concept, that the solution to any of its problem is reform, not dissolution. We think that the stock market is required for large companies to raise capital and a great way for investors to share in the profits of a company. But when we finally stop to deeply examine public stock ownership, we only find unnecessary contradictions and absurdities.

### The Disconnect Between Ownership and Control
To own a share of a company, means to own the company. When entrepreneurs start companies, we unanimously agree they own the company. We also unanimously agree, at least in the early business, that the success of that business is determined by the blood, sweat, and tears of the owners. They own the business, and they *are* the business.

However, when a shareholder buys a share of a stock on the public stock market, they have little to no say in any operation in the entire company. Managers and executives who may have no ownership of the company have all legal control. There is almost nothing else in life that I can buy, but not control. I can't buy a house that I can never enter; I can't buy a sandwich that I can never eat.

### The Illusion of Profit Sharing
One of the supposed benefits of stock ownership is that shareholders get to share in the profits. But many companies never pay dividends, and of the few that do, it's almost always tiny fraction of total profits.

Profits go to salaries, cash stashes, development, and financial engineering like stock buybacks, not to shareholders. And while I'll avoid venturing too far in to subjective opinion, likely the most benefit of profits go only to a few executives and a few executives of large institutional shareholding companies.

### The Absurdity of Stock Ownership vs. Debt
In a rational system, owners (shareholders in a publicly traded company) have ultimate control of assets and the company's fate. However, in our current system, the opposite is true.

Somehow, in our companies, debt holders can have power that owners never get. For a company in financial distress, a debt holder can control all assets and all company process. Shareholders have almost no say in the companies they own. In financial distress they can be wiped out entirely.

This contradiction highlights that the modern corporation has evolved into a complex web of irrational abstract claims and legal fiction that usually have little resemblance to reality.

### Alternative Models
Now that we've shown the absurdity of public stock ownership, we must propose alternatives to prove this system requires dissolution. If any corporate structures can sensibly align the interest of all stakeholders and reconnect business ownership with full responsibility and control, we would clearly have a better system that mirrors the concept of ownership in all other life contexts.

1. Enforcing a greater reliance on debt financing:
   This provides capital without the deserving owners surrendering ownership. While debt sometimes comes with unique legal challenges, to the investors, the downside to a default is nearly the same as a stock price hitting zero.
2. Cooperatives: Businesses owned and controlled by their members, who are usually the people who use its services or products. Profits are distributed based on participation, not ownership share. Examples include credit unions and agricultural co-ops.
3. Steward-Ownership: Companies owned by a trust or foundation and managed for the benefit of its mission and stakeholders, not to enrich absentee shareholders. Profits are reinvested or donated. Examples include Bosch and Zeiss.
4. Mission-Driven Entities: Businesses with a social or environmental mission. They can be benefit corporations (B-Corps) or social purpose corporations. They don't fundamentally solve the problem of absentee ownership and the disconnect between shareholders and the company's operations. However, they do represent an attempt to realign corporate priorities and make businesses more accountable to a broader set of stakeholders. Examples include Patagonia and Kickstarter.
5. ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans):
   A plan that gives workers ownership in the company. Employees earn a financial stake over time, and the company gets tax benefits. By giving employees a real stake in the company's success, ESOPs align the interests of workers with the long-term health of the business. It creates a culture of ownership, engagement, and accountability. This is a stark contrast to the modern stock market, where shareholders have little connection to the companies they own. Examples include New Belgium Brewing and W.L. Gore (makers of Gore-Tex).

I believe these alternatives align ownership with stakeholders. They help fix the problematic nonsensical absentee shareholder model I think we often think of as a fundamental law of social physics.

### Conclusion
The current system of public stock ownership is a contradiction and absurdity. It creates a disconnect between ownership and control, an illusion of profit sharing, and an inversion of traditional ownership rights.

Upon closer inspection, stock markets seem to have more in common with a hypothetical corrupt Kentucky Derby, than an ethical business process. But abolishing stock markets will likely never happen, and may not be a worthwhile fight in most possible circumstances. No matter what, it's of everyone's benefit to strive for a more rational and balanced ecosystem in corporate finance. By exploring alternative models that better align incentives and reconnect ownership with stewardship, we can work towards building a more equitable, sustainable, and productive economy for the long term. When we question the assumptions and abstractions of the current system - we begin to envision and build a better one.

If you're inspired by the potential of alternative ownership models like ESOPs, I encourage you to learn more and get involved by checking out the resources at the National Center for Employee Ownership ([https://www.nceo.org/](https://www.nceo.org/)), and consider advocating for policies and practices that support the growth of a more equitable and sustainable economy.
